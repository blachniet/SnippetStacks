This project is meant to simply be a collection of useful code snippets for use in Visual Studio. In order to use these snippets:
* In Visual Studio go to _Tools_, _Code Snippets Manager..._
* Select the language
* Click the _Add_ button
* Navigate to the corresponding *Snippet Stacks* language folder
  
Feel free to contribute your own code snippets. I will try to pull in any pull requests as quickly as possible.
